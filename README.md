# CO2 Emissions, Renewable Energy, and Electricity Generation Dashboard  

This repository contains the final project for the Data Analytics course at Coderhouse. The project focuses on creating an interactive dashboard to analyze global CO2 emissions, renewable energy usage, and electricity generation trends from 1950 to 2022.

## Introduction  
The goal of this project was to design a user-friendly, interactive dashboard for visualizing and understanding trends in CO2 emissions, renewable energy adoption, and electricity generation. The dashboard supports decision-making by highlighting key trends and comparisons across countries and regions.  

## Features  
- Analysis of historical CO2 emissions by country and region.  
- Insights into renewable energy adoption and fossil fuel usage.  
- Visualization of energy and electricity production trends.  
- Financial flow data related to renewable energy projects.  
- Interactive filters for detailed exploration by year, region, and energy type.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Power BI**: Dashboard creation and interactive visualizations.  
- **SQL**: Querying and integrating data from multiple sources.  
- **DAX**: Creating calculated measures and metrics in Power BI.  

## Datasets  
The project uses three datasets:  
1. [CO2 Emissions Data](https://github.com/owid/co2-data)  
2. [Energy Data](https://github.com/owid/energy-data)  
3. [Sustainable Energy Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy)  

## Key Insights  
- Industrialized regions are reducing emissions through renewable energy adoption.  
- Developing regions show rising emissions due to industrialization but are attracting significant investments in renewables.  
- Renewable energy usage is increasing globally but still represents a small percentage of the energy matrix.  
- Electricity production is shifting towards renewable sources, though fossil fuels remain dominant.  

## Future Work  
- Include analysis of additional renewable energy types, such as biomass.  
- Add demographic and economic indicators (e.g., population, GDP) for deeper insights.  
- Group countries by intergovernmental organizations (e.g., OECD, G20) for trend evaluation.
